Based on the provided `composer.json` and `package.json` files, I'll guide you through the installation process step by step.

**Prerequisites**

* PHP 8.2 or higher (required by Laravel)
* Node.js 14 or higher (required by Vite)
* Composer (the package manager for PHP)
* npm (the package manager for JavaScript)
* mysql (if you want to install on linux you can it out here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRfI79BHf3k)


**Step 1: Install PHP dependencies using Composer**

```bash
composer install
```

**Step 2: Install Node.js dependencies using npm**

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3: Create a .env file**

1. Run the following command to create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
This command will copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.

**Step 4: Generate the application key**

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
This command will generate a new application key and store it in the `.env` file.

**Step 5: Run the database migrations**

1. Run the following command to run the database migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

**Step 6: Start the development server**

1. Run the following command to start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Step 7: Start the Laravel development server**

1. Run the following command to start the Laravel development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

**Additional requirements**

* Make sure you have a database set up and configured in the `.env` file.
* If you're using a virtual machine or a containerization platform like Docker, you may need to configure the environment variables and database connections accordingly.




If the error messages indicate that the following extensions are missing:

* `ext-dom`
* `ext-xml`

To fix this, you'll need to install and enable these extensions on your system. Here are the steps to do so:

**For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:**

1. Run the following command to install the extensions:
```bash
sudo apt-get install php8.3-dom php8.3-xml
```

**For other Linux distributions:**

1. Check your distribution's package manager documentation to install the `php-dom` and `php-xml` packages.
2. Restart the Apache server (if you're using it).

**For macOS (with Homebrew):**

1. Run the following command to install the extensions:
```bash
brew install php@8.3 --with-dom --with-xml
```
Replace `php@8.3` with the version of PHP you're using (e.g., `php@8.1`, `php@8.2`, etc.).

2. Restart the Apache server (if you're using it).

**After installing the extensions:**

1. Run the following command to verify that the extensions are installed and enabled:
```bash
php -m
```
This should list the installed extensions, including `dom` and `xml`.

2. Try running `composer install` again to see if the issue is resolved.




1. **MySQL extension is not enabled**: If you have the MySQL extension installed, make sure it's enabled in your PHP configuration. You can check by running `php -i` and looking for `mysql` or `mysqli` in the list of enabled extensions.
2. **MySQL connection settings are incorrect**: Make sure your MySQL connection settings are correct in the `.env` file. Check the `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` variables.

To fix this issue, you can try the following:

**For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:**

1. Install the MySQL extension:
```bash
sudo apt-get install php8.3-mysql
```

2. Restart the Apache server (if you're using it):
```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

**For other Linux distributions:**

1. Check your distribution's package manager documentation to install the `php-mysql` package.
2. Restart the Apache server (if you're using it).

**For macOS (with Homebrew):**

1. Install the MySQL extension:
```bash
brew install php@8.3 --with-mysql
```
Replace `php@8.3` with the version of PHP you're using (e.g., `php@8.1`, `php@8.2`, etc.).

2. Restart the Apache server (if you're using it).

**After installing the MySQL extension:**

1. Try running `php artisan migrate` again to see if the issue is resolved.

If you're still having trouble, you can try checking the MySQL connection settings in the `.env` file and making sure they're correct.
